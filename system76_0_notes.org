** Missing Letters After Suspend
In Fedora 35, after suspending and resuming, not all letters would render. Newly drawn buffers / screens were ok, but buffers from before the suspend had missing letters.
*** Fix
Edit ~/usr/lib/modprobe.d/nvidia-power-management.conf~ set ~NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations~ to ~0~.

~NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations~ appears to be a setting related to preserving memory locations during suspend / resume.
